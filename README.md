## Original README

### Framer Library

The Framer library is the code that drives Framer projects and components. It helps you build from simple interactive components to whole apps.

Framer helps you to do animations, events and interpolation as a set of helpers to React. It also provides a set of common components for device, scrolling, paging and navigation.
